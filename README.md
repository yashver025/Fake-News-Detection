# Fake-News-Detection
The Fake News Detection Project uses machine learning and NLP to classify news as reliable or unreliable. It preprocesses text (removing noise, stemming, and stopword removal), extracts features using TF-IDF, and applies a trained model for predictions. A Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface to verify content and combat misinformation.
